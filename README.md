# Air Quality in Los Angeles County: A Data Visualization Project  

## Your Name and Course Information  
**Name:** Lauren Landa 
**Course:** CS 150

## Thesis Statement  
This data visualization project explores the patterns and trends in air quality across Los Angeles County, focusing on ozone levels and PM2.5 concentrations. By visualizing these key pollutants, the goal is to highlight the spatial and temporal variability of air quality, especially in relation to potential health impacts on vulnerable populations.  

## Context for Your Data Visualization  
Air pollution is a significant environmental and public health issue, particularly in urban areas like Los Angeles. The dashboard presents a dynamic view of air quality by mapping the locations of testing sites in the county. The map allows users to explore the spatial distribution of air pollution levels, while the line chart shows how ozone and PM2.5 levels have fluctuated over time. By comparing these variables, the visualization aims to offer insights into trends that could inform public policy and personal health decisions, particularly for those with respiratory issues.  

## Data You Will Be Visualizing  
The data being visualized comes from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the form of a CSV containing air quality measurements across multiple testing sites in Los Angeles County. Specifically, the dataset includes measurements for:  

- **Ozone levels (O3)**  
- **PM2.5 concentrations (fine particulate matter)**  

The data is organized by location (latitude, longitude) and provides historical data on these pollutants, making it ideal for both spatial and temporal analysis.  

## Specific Strategies from *Storytelling with Data* (SwD) to Make Your Visualization Effective  
To ensure the effectiveness of this visualization, I will apply the following strategies from *Storytelling with Data*:  

1. **Contextualization**: Provide clear annotations and labels on the map and line chart to help users understand what the data represents. This will ensure that the user can interpret the air quality measurements and their implications.  

2. **Simplifying Complexity**: By separating the spatial analysis (map) from the temporal analysis (line chart), I reduce cognitive overload. Each visualization focuses on one key aspect: spatial distribution or trends over time.  

3. **Use of Color**: I will use a color gradient on the map to represent varying levels of pollution, where darker shades indicate higher pollution levels. For the line chart, color-coded lines will differentiate between the different sites, and dotted and solid lines to distinguish ozone and PM2.5, making it easy for the user to follow and compare.  

4. **Narrative Flow**: The dashboard design will guide the user through the story of air quality in LA, first by looking at the locations and then exploring historical data trends, thereby creating a logical flow from spatial to temporal analysis.
