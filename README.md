# Air Quality in Los Angeles County: A Data Visualization Project  

## Name and Course Information  
**Name:** Lauren Landa  

**Instructor Name:** Mike Ryu  

**Course:** CS 150  

## Thesis Statement  
This data visualization project explores the patterns and trends in air quality across Los Angeles County, focusing on ozone levels and PM2.5 concentrations. Given the vast size of LA County—spanning over 4,000 square miles—air quality can vary significantly from one region to another. By mapping these key pollutants, the goal is to highlight the spatial and temporal variability of air quality, especially in relation to potential health impacts on vulnerable populations.  

## Context for Your Data Visualization  
Los Angeles County is the most populous county in the United States and is geographically diverse, containing urban centers, suburban areas, coastal regions, and mountain ranges. Because of this vastness, air quality can differ widely across different locations. For example, inland areas tend to experience higher pollution levels due to trapped emissions, whereas coastal areas may have better air quality due to ocean breezes.  

The dashboard presents a dynamic view of air quality by mapping the locations of air quality testing sites across the county. The map is a particularly useful visualization for this dataset because it allows users to explore how pollution levels vary across LA’s large and diverse landscape. In addition to the map, a line chart provides a historical perspective, showing how ozone and PM2.5 levels have fluctuated over time. By comparing these variables, the visualization aims to offer insights that could inform public policy and personal health decisions, particularly for those with respiratory issues.  

## Data You Will Be Visualizing  
The data being visualized comes from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the form of a CSV containing air quality measurements across multiple testing sites in Los Angeles County. Specifically, the dataset includes measurements for:  

- **Ozone levels (O3)**  
- **PM2.5 concentrations (fine particulate matter)**  

The data is organized by location (latitude, longitude) and provides historical data on these pollutants, making it ideal for both spatial and temporal analysis.  

## Specific Strategies from *Storytelling with Data* (SwD) to Make Your Visualization Effective  
To ensure the effectiveness of this visualization, I will apply the following strategies from *Storytelling with Data*:  

1. **Contextualization**: Provide clear annotations and labels on the map and line chart to help users understand what the data represents. This will ensure that the user can interpret the air quality measurements and their implications.  

2. **Emphasizing Spatial Distribution**: Since LA County is so large, a map is an essential tool for conveying the variation in air quality across different regions. Users can zoom in on specific areas to explore how pollution levels compare between neighborhoods.  

3. **Use of Color**: I will use a color gradient on the map to represent varying levels of pollution, where darker shades indicate higher pollution levels. For the line chart, color-coded lines will differentiate between the different sites, and dotted and solid lines will distinguish ozone and PM2.5, making it easy for the user to follow and compare.  

4. **Narrative Flow**: The dashboard design will guide the user through the story of air quality in LA, first by looking at the locations and their pollution levels, then exploring historical data trends, thereby creating a logical flow from spatial to temporal analysis.
