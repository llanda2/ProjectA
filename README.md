### **Thesis Statement**
This project aims to visualize and analyze air quality data in Boyle Heights, a neighborhood in Los Angeles, highlighting the impact of poor air quality on respiratory health, especially for vulnerable individuals like young children, during high pollution events such as wildfires.

---

### **Context**
Air quality plays a crucial role in public health, particularly in communities like Boyle Heights, where a significant portion of the population suffers from respiratory issues. Poor air quality, exacerbated by wildfires and other sources of pollution, can lead to severe health consequences. For example, young children like Polo, who is prone to respiratory episodes, are particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of air pollution. By visualizing air quality data, this dashboard serves as a tool to help residents and healthcare providers understand when air quality is likely to be harmful and take necessary precautions.

### **Data Being Visualized**
The data for this visualization comes from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and includes air quality information for the Los Angeles area, specifically focusing on Boyle Heights. The dataset includes:
- **Date**: The specific date of the air quality measurement.
- **AQI**: The Air Quality Index, which indicates the level of pollution and associated health risks.
- **Pollutants**: Levels of specific pollutants such as PM2.5, Ozone, Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), and Carbon Monoxide (CO), which contribute to the overall AQI.

This data will be visualized in interactive charts that allow users to explore the changes in air quality over time and understand the risks associated with different pollutant levels.

### **Specific Strategies from SwD (Storytelling with Data) Employed**
To make the visualization both effective and engaging, the following strategies from *Storytelling with Data* will be employed:
- **Clarity**: The visualizations will be simple and easy to understand, with clear labels and legends. The AQI will be color-coded (e.g., green for good air quality, red for hazardous air) to help users quickly interpret the data.
- **Contextualization**: The dashboard will include contextual information, such as the health impacts of various AQI levels and the specific pollutants that contribute to the overall score. This helps viewers understand why certain AQI values are more harmful to respiratory health.
- **Interactivity**: The dashboard will feature interactive elements, such as dropdowns or sliders, to allow users to filter data by pollutant or specific time periods. This interactivity makes the dashboard more dynamic and engaging, allowing users to explore the data in ways that are most relevant to their needs.
- **Focus**: The visualizations will focus on key events, such as the 2025 wildfires, and highlight how air quality during these events worsens compared to normal conditions. This allows the audience to see patterns and make connections between air quality and health risks.
